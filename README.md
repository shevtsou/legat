1. Issue = Low speed of human intelligence powers
2. Premise = There is algorithm/algorithms that can improve itself, to make more advanced algorithms
3. Solution = Find way to recreate this algorithm
3.1 One possible solution = try to "bruteforce" all code slutions
3.1.1 Issue = too low performance of current computer power
3.2 Find algorithm by yourself
4. Implementation details
4.1 Difficulty for environment calculated by how much logical, structure operators need to implement solution for it.
