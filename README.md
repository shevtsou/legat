1. Issue = Low speed of human intelligence powers
2. Premise = There is algorithm/algorithms that can improve itself, to make more advanced algorithms
3. Solution = Find way to recreate this algorithm
3.1 One possible solution = try to "bruteforce" all code slutions
3.1.1 Issue = too low performance of current computer power
3.2 Find algorithm by yourself
3.2.1
